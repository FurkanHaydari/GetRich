Bot that trades stock market based on tweets.

First of all, you should follow the coinbase account from your twitter account and turn on notifications. 

I used the ftx site for stock market transactions, since there is no 2-step verification, I can connect quickly with cookies using selenium.

CoinBase is a crypto trading exchange. It lists altcoins on a weekly basis, when it lists the price of that coin pumps. 

My goal is to buy when coinbase tweets the listing.

My app logs into twitter and ftx sites with firefox cookies. 

In my Twitter account, coinbase tweets are dropping as notifications. 

The code must run 24 hours for effective use.
